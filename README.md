### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Marco, I am a 15 years old guy that creates stuff that is basically useless, but at least I learn something doing it!<br>
*(even if I will forget it the day later)*

### What can I do?
I can code in C#, Python, Node.JS and PHP. I can use Photoshop (and Gimp), InDesign, Premiere, Blender, and KeyShot.
